# Uber.html

## Description

The project employs a combination of HTML tags to meet specific requirements and is split into two separate files: an HTML file, which contains the project's information, and a CSS file, which offers detailed styling instructions to enhance its visual presentation. By linking the CSS file to the HTML file, the desired design elements are seamlessly applied. This integration significantly improves the overall aesthetic quality of the project.. It serves as a playground for experimenting with different web development techniques, such as layout design, styling, and interactivity.
